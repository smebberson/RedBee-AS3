## About

This is an ActionScript 3 library allowing you directly interact with the RedBee RFID reader from within ActionScript (Flex, AIR and Flash).
Most of the documentation, in fact all, that comes with RedBee is PC and .NET oriented. I wanted to provide something that is MAC and ActionScript oriented. Arduino and Phidgets have good support for those platforms, and hopefully RedBee does now too.

I'm yet to commit the version version of the Library, but that should be coming shortly.
