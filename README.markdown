## About

This is an ActionScript 3 library allowing you directly interact with the RedBee RFID reader from within ActionScript (Flex, AIR and Flash).
Most of the documentation, in fact all, that comes with RedBee is PC and .NET oriented. I wanted to provide something that is MAC and ActionScript oriented. Arduino and Phidgets have good support for those platforms, and hopefully RedBee does now too.

## Features

*	recieve an asynchronous tag swipe event (theoretically supports other asynchronous events, but are untested as yet)
*	retrieve the firmware version of the RedBee
